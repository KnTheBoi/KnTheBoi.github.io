                <div class="phase_content">
                    <p>To think about it, I guess I do not even remember since when did I start to have this burning passion for technology, specifically computers, the programs and every beautiful aspect of it. It was lucky of me to had the chance to interact with hardwares early on in life. I can still remember the days figuring out systems and programs, all just to satisfy my curiosity, or just to find a way to play a certain block game.</p>

                <div class="phase_content">
                    <p>After years of interaction, I could do what most of the new generation are familiar with nowadays *chuckle*, but then I learned about programming, about the languages, the conversations between machinery and, and I found it fascinating, a form of art that this untalented person can dare to put hands into.<br>
                    I have finally found the true inspiration in this life, or was it just a spur of the moment, that I do not know. But there was indeed a path that laid open in front of my eyes.</p>

                <h2>Phase 3 (<span class="orange">Current</span>)</h2>
                <div class="phase_content">
                    <p>In high school, I started to expand my connections and grew more eager to learn about programming. I happened to befriend some seniors. I started to ask for tutor sessions. That was when I learned my first programming language: <span class="orange">C++</span><br>
                        We worked together, made a small group, and helped each other out. With some projects as practice, we have successfully established some fundamentals as programmers. As for myself, I have gained valuable experience.<br>
                        Now I am currently studying abroad, in Australia as a freshman at <span class="orange">University of Technology Sydney</span>, in the hope of pursuing higher knowledge.</p>
